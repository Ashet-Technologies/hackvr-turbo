<epoch> rotation /should/ be group-relative, but I don't have the code for that in my version yet
<epoch> those movements are absolute
<epoch> if you put a + before them, they're relative
<epoch> rotate 0 90 0 #sets rotation to 90
<epoch> rotate 0 45 0 #sets rotation to 45, not 90 + 45
<epoch> rotate 0 +45 0 #sets rotation to 45 more than what it was
<epoch> rotate 0 +-45 0 #sets rotation to 45 less than what it was
<epoch> and those 0s are absolutes too
<epoch> so if there was a rotation on the x or z before any of those, they'd get reset to 0
<epoch> the moves are in the global directions probably
<epoch> and they set absolute too
<epoch> unless using + before the values
<epoch> if you do "forward" it is the group's positive z after rotation
<epoch> so you can have something loop on: "rotate 0 +5 0" and "move forward" and it'll walk in a circle
<epoch> "circle"
<epoch> n-gon of 360/5 sides or something
<xq> thanks  for clarification :)
<xq> so move forward is relative, but move +0 +0 +1 is absolute *grin*
<epoch> I'm kind of AFK doing cleaning, so leave questions and I'll answer when I check my screen.
<xq> (so to speak: without rotation)
<xq> but makes implementation easier for me :
<xq> *girn*
<xq> no fancy transforms
<xq> this allows me to display the maze soonish *joy*
<epoch> the fancy transforms can usually be done by building up multiple commands.
<SegFault> om mani padme hum
<epoch> ...
<epoch> someone said something about an "Abort, Retry, Fail" keychain
<epoch> but made me think of other situtations where those three options would apply.

<epoch> > Abort, Retry, Fail
<epoch> *cough*

<epoch> hackvr over gemini.
<epoch> not just static either
<epoch> gemini-get gemini://gemini.thebackupbox.net/hackvr-stream | hackvr | tr '\n' '\0' | uriescape | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -I{} gemini-get 'gemini://gemini.thebackupbox.net/hackvr-input?{}'

-except/#default- title:
<epoch> or whatever it is
<epoch> similar would work for http
<epoch> as long as the protocol can stay open forever.
<epoch> still not sure if gemini will support that
<epoch> solderpunk liked that idea of doing tail -f over gemini though
